<h1>Hi, I'm Akash Savitala!</h1>

<h2>Background:</h2>

<p>Electrical and Computer Engineering major with 3+ years of experience spanning software engineering, applied machine learning, and research. Worked on detector and image analysis projects at national laboratories, developed analytics and reliability features in production environments, and built end-to-end applications ranging from AI-powered web platforms to autonomous systems. Passionate about creating practical, research-driven solutions that bridge ML and engineering.</p>

<h2>Projects:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Quick Find (AI-Driven E-Commerce Platform)</b>
    <p><b>Summary: </b>Full-stack MERN web app that integrates OpenAI and the eBay API to power AI-driven shopping recommendations, with a serverless Firebase backend for authentication and data storage.</p>

<h2>Research:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Kinetic Inductance Phonon-Mediated (KIPM) Detector Characterization at Cryogenic Temperatures</b>
    <p><b>Summary: </b>Built a Python-based analysis pipeline that ingests raw instrument data of vector network analyzer (VNA) frequency sweeps, cleans and normalizes it, fits a nonlinear least-squares model to extract key metrics, and generates calibrated plots — turning cryogenic detector measurements into reproducible, power-vs-response insights.</p>

  </li>
  
  <li>
    <b>Quantum-Enhanced Speech Recognition in Noisy Environments</b>
    <p><b>Summary: </b>Designed and analyzed a quantum machine learning model to improve speech recognition accuracy under noisy conditions by leveraging quantum noise filtering and pattern recognition. Compared performance with traditional deep learning methods (CNNs, LSTMs) to show stronger noise reduction and better recognition reliability, demonstrating how quantum algorithms can optimize real-world voice-activated systems for accessibility and user experience.</p>

  <li>
    <b>5G Research Paper – Seattle Information Technology Implementation Plan</b>
    <p><b>Summary: </b>Analyzed the technical, social, and policy impacts of 5G deployment with a focus on improving public safety, digital equity, and healthcare in urban areas. Proposed AT&T FirstNet integration for emergency services, telehealth expansion for underserved communities, and IoT-based traffic management using 5G’s low latency. Highlighted cybersecurity and infrastructure challenges and provided solutions for balancing innovation with safety and inclusivity, showing how next-generation networks can support smarter, more connected cities.</p>

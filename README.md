<h2>Research:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Kinetic Inductance Phonon-Mediated (KIPM) Detector Characterization at Cryogenic Temperatures</b>
    <p><b>Summary: </b>Built a Python-based analysis pipeline that ingests raw instrument data of vector network analyzer (VNA) frequency sweeps, cleans and normalizes it, fits a nonlinear least-squares model to extract key metrics, and generates calibrated plots â€” turning cryogenic detector measurements into reproducible, power-vs-response insights.</p>

  <li>
    <b>Quantum-Enhanced Speech Recognition in Noisy Environments</b>
    <p><b>Summary: </b>Designed and analyzed a quantum machine learning model to improve speech recognition accuracy under noisy conditions by leveraging quantum noise filtering and pattern recognition. Compared performance with traditional deep learning methods (CNNs, LSTMs) to show stronger noise reduction and better recognition reliability, demonstrating how quantum algorithms can optimize real-world voice-activated systems for accessibility and user experience.</p>

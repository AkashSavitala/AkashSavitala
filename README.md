<h1>Hi, I'm Akash Savitala!</h1>

<h2>Background:</h2>

<p>Electrical and Computer Engineering major with 3+ years of experience spanning software engineering, applied machine learning, and research. Worked on detector and image analysis projects at national laboratories, developed analytics and reliability features in production environments, and built end-to-end applications ranging from AI-powered web platforms to autonomous systems. Passionate about creating practical, research-driven solutions that bridge ML and engineering.</p>

<h2>Projects:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Quick Find</b>
    <p><b>Summary: </b>Full-stack MERN web app that integrates OpenAI and the eBay API to power AI-driven shopping recommendations, with a serverless Firebase backend for authentication and data storage.</p>
